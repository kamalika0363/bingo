This project is for the **HACKANOVA** 3.0 held on 16th and 17th February 2024
The problem statement was **Budget Buddy**
And we have created a Telegram chatbot to calculate and analyze the expendure done by a indiviual and get the other benfits like 
  1. Give a graph of our expendure
  2. Helps us to take a decision to use a large amount on investment or not 
  3. Compare the Expenses according to the category such as Food, clothing, miscellaneous, and Rent.
  4. We can also upload the bills and the chat bot will detemine the category and will get the final amount as expendure.
